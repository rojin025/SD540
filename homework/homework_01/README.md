### Homework 01 - Errors

Edit this file and write your answers for the first two questions:

1. What is the difference in handling a Sync Error vs. Async Error?
   Sync error handling deals with errors immediately during blocking operations for eg: Systax error.
   Async error handling manages errors asynchronously after non-blocking operations complete. Using Try Catch Block.

2. Create a custom Error object that has two additional properties `status`,and `log`. Use it in an example.
   Check out file "customError.ts" -> npm run start.

3. Fix all the Type errors in the provided code.
